# OOP exercise

Your task is to write a utility class that performs various calculations and conversions. The implementation should be as abstract as possible (with the things we learned so far). Of course, it must be object orientated.

What things should the program at least be able to do?

- Some conversions like Fahrenheit to Celcius.

- Calculate speed/time/distance. Let the user decide what he wants to calculate.

- In another class you should make use of your utility class. There write a short user interaction. Read numbers in and so on.

- Calculate prime numbers. Let the user decide how many he wants to calculate.

  More information about prime numbers can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)


> Of course you can add more features and adapt to your interests. Maybe you have some hobby or leisure activity for which you can write a small utility class.

The formula for velocity and some prime number examples are in the PDF file.
